## 👩‍💻 About the Project

Spam messages are a real-world problem affecting millions of users daily.  
In this project, I built a **machine learning-based SMS classification system** that automatically detects whether a message is spam or not.

This project demonstrates:
- Practical use of NLP in real applications
- End-to-end ML workflow
- Real-time deployment on cloud
